For the school I am working at, this meant that the timetable schedule changed multiple times across several months. My staff room buddy and I grumbled about the daily issue of constantly recalculating what school period we were in, and thus the idea was born.</p>
                    <p>This started off as a one day hackathon. The first prototype showed the schedule for the day, highlighted what period it currently is, and had options to change the lengths of periods and breaks.</p>
                    <p>The following week was spent setting up the hosting and making design tweaks so that other staff members could access the site on any device (mainly the school-provided iPads), integrating extra functionalities, and adding Japanese language support.</p>
